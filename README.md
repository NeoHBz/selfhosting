# Self Hosting

### Introduction
Self Hosting is the practice of running and maintaining a website or service using a private web server, instead of using a service outside of someone's own control.

This takes away all the "unknown" factor in how your data is stored and processed by the big tech giants, providing the user to take complete control of their data without losing the functionality of the services they otherwise use frequently.

### Examples

- Self Hosting your own version of app server to cut costs on subscriptions
  - NextCloud instead of Google Drive or Dropbox can save you around *$30 annually*
  - Joplin instead of Evernote subscription can save you around *$55 annually*.
  - UptimeKuma instead of UptimeRobot can save you around *$80 annually*.
  - Plex, a media server for multimedia content, can save you upto *$120 annually*.
  - VaultWarden instead of BitWarden can save you upto *$10 annually*.
  - Damselfly or Immich instead of Google Photos can save you around *$16 annually*.
  - TypeBot instead of TypeForm can save you *$300 annually*

And the list can go on. ([Visit complete list of Self Hosted solutions here](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted))
