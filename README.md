# Self Hosting

Self Hosting is the practice of running and maintaining a website or service using a private web server, instead of using a service outside of someone's own control.

This takes away all the "unknown" factor in how your data is stored and processed by the big tech giants, providing the user to take complete control of their data without losing the functionality of the services they otherwise use frequently.

- Self Hosting your own version of app server to cut costs on subscriptions
  - Joplin instead of Evernote subscription can save you around *$55 annually*.

  - Plex, a media server for multimedia content, can save you upto *$120 annually*.
  - VaultWarden instead of BitWarden can save you upto *$10 annually*.
